# Tensor Dodge

Tensor Dodge (Tensor referring to TensorFlow) is an interactive game where the character movement is controlled by the real-life actions of the user. The aim of the game is to jump and collect diamonds, while moving left and right to avoid the falling anvils. The application makes use of only one input device: a common, general-purpose computer webcam. Tensor Dodge targets children below the age of 15, being easy to understand, but progressively harder to master. The game aims to promote physical exercise by being both immersive and challenging, ensuring that the player is trying their hardest to achieve a high score while being active and moving around.
